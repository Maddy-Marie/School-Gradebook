This gradebook application is written in C++. It reads in student grade information from a text file (test1/2), processes the grades, and ouputs them into a new file (output1/2). The user has the opportunity to search for a student, change a student's grades, add a student to the classlist, and process final grades for the course. This is one of the bigger programs I have written in C++, as it was a final project for a course. To run, compile the student.cpp and studentList.cpp files (g++ -c <fileNameHere>), compile the main program (g++ main.cpp student.o studentList.o), and, finally, run with command ./a.out - Enjoy!
